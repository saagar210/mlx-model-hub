## Context
This folder contains AI-related projects including the RAG knowledge base system.

## Primary Project: RAG Knowledge Base
A retrieval-augmented generation system for:
- Document ingestion and chunking
- Semantic search across personal knowledge
- Query augmentation with retrieved context

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- LLM: Local Ollama models with Claude API fallback
- Vector DB: To be determined (Chroma, Pinecone, pgvector)
- Backend: Python/FastAPI
- Frontend: Browser-based interface

## Target Accuracy
85%+ retrieval accuracy by project completion

## Project-Specific Rules
- Test with diverse document types
- Benchmark retrieval quality regularly
- Document chunking strategies and their trade-offs
- Keep costs in mind when choosing cloud vs local
