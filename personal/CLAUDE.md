# Personal Projects
# Category for side projects and experiments

## Context
Catch-all for personal projects that don't fit other categories. These can be experimental or just for fun.

## Rules
- Lower barrier for experimentation
- Can use any tech stack
- Documentation optional for quick experiments
- Promote to dedicated category if project grows significant
