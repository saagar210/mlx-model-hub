# Minimal Vite Template

**⚠️ DO NOT SELECT THIS TEMPLATE** unless explicitly requested by the user.

Bare-bones Vite + TypeScript + Cloudflare Workers scaffolding with minimal dependencies. Use **vite-reference** for most projects instead.

## When to Use

**ONLY use when:**
- User explicitly requests "minimal" or "bare-bones" template
- Starting completely from scratch with zero UI components
- Building something that doesn't fit existing templates

**Use vite-reference instead if:**
- Building a standard web application
- Need UI components (buttons, forms, dialogs)
- Need routing, state management, or common patterns
- Unsure which template to use

This template intentionally lacks features that most applications need. Choose vite-reference for a better starting point.
