# 👥 Daily Team Status

> For an overview of all available workflows, see the [main README](../README.md).

The [daily team status workflow](../workflows/daily-team-status.md?plain=1) will assess activity in the repository and create a status report issue. You can edit the workflow to adjust the topics and texture of the report. 

## Installation

```bash
# Install the 'gh aw' extension
gh extension install githubnext/gh-aw

# Add the Daily Team Status workflow to your repository
gh aw add githubnext/agentics/daily-team-status --pr
```

This creates a pull request to add the workflow to your repository.

You must also add [choose a coding agent](https://githubnext.github.io/gh-aw/reference/engines/) and add an API key secret for the agent to your repository.

After merging the PR and syncing to main, you can start a run of this workflow immediately by running:

```bash
gh aw run daily-team-status
```

**Mandatory Checklist**

* [ ] If in a fork, enable GitHub Actions and Issues in the fork settings
