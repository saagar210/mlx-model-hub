# 🔍 Daily Accessibility Review

> For an overview of all available workflows, see the [main README](../README.md).

The [daily accessibility review workflow](../workflows/daily-accessibility-review.md?plain=1) will perform accessibility reviews of the application.

## Installation

```bash
# Install the 'gh aw' extension
gh extension install githubnext/gh-aw

# Add the Daily Accessibility Review workflow to your repository
gh aw add githubnext/agentics/daily-accessibility-review --pr
```

This creates an issue in your repository recording accessibility problems found.

You must also add [choose a coding agent](https://githubnext.github.io/gh-aw/reference/engines/) and add an API key secret for the agent to your repository.

After merging the PR and syncing to main, you can start a run of this workflow immediately by running:

```bash
gh aw run daily-accessibility-review
```

**Mandatory Checklist**

* [ ] I understand that, by default, the agentic portion of this workflow will generate and run bash commands in the confine of the GitHub Actions VM, with network access.

* [ ] If in a fork, enable GitHub Actions and Issues in the fork settings

## Configuration

This workflow requires no configuration and works out of the box. You can use local configuration to specify which accessibility standards to check (e.g., WCAG 2.1, WCAG 2.2), types of accessibility issues to prioritize, and reporting format. Local configuration can be done in `.github/workflows/agentics/daily-accessibility-review.config.md`.

After editing run `gh aw compile` to update the workflow and commit all changes to the default branch.
