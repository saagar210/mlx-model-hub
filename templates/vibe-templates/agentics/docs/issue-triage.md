# 🏷️ Issue Triage

> For an overview of all available workflows, see the [main README](../README.md).

The [issue triage workflow](../workflows/issue-triage.md?plain=1) will when issues are created or reopened to triage issues in the repository.

## Installation

```bash
# Install the 'gh aw' extension
gh extension install githubnext/gh-aw

# Add the Issue Triage workflow to your repository
gh aw add githubnext/agentics/issue-triage --pr
```

This creates a pull request to add the workflow to your repository.

You must also [choose a coding agent](https://githubnext.github.io/gh-aw/reference/engines/) and add an API key secret for the agent to your repository.

You can't start a run of this workflow directly as it is triggered in the context of an issue.

**Mandatory Checklist**

* [ ] If in a fork, enable GitHub Actions and Issues in the fork settings

## Configuration

This workflow requires no configuration and works out of the box. You can use local configuration to customize triage criteria, labeling logic, customize issue categorization, modify automated responses. Local configuration can be done in `.github/workflows/agentics/issue-triage.config.md`.

2. Add MCPs to integrate with project management tools

After editing run `gh aw compile` to update the workflow and commit all changes to the default branch.
