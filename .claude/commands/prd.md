# Generate PRD

Use the prd-taskmaster skill to generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document.

**Invoke skill:** prd-taskmaster

This skill will:
1. Ask 12+ smart discovery questions to understand your idea
2. Generate a comprehensive PRD with 11 sections
3. Validate quality with 13 automated checks
4. Auto-initialize Task Master and create `.taskmaster/` structure
5. Parse PRD into tasks with complexity estimates
6. Expand tasks into subtasks
7. Offer autonomous execution or handoff

**Activation phrases that work:**
- "I want a PRD for [idea]"
- "Create requirements for [feature]"
- "Build me a [product]"

**After PRD is generated:**
- Use `/next-task` to start implementation
- Or choose autonomous execution mode
