# PRD Interview

Start the PRD development workflow for a new project or major feature.

## Interview Phase 1: Core Understanding
Ask clarifying questions about:
1. **Goals**: What problem are we solving? What does success look like?
2. **Users**: Who will use this? What are their skill levels?
3. **Scope**: What's in scope vs explicitly out of scope?
4. **Constraints**: Timeline, budget, technical limitations?

## Interview Phase 2: Deep Dive
After initial answers, probe deeper:
1. **Edge cases**: What happens when things go wrong?
2. **Integration**: How does this connect to existing systems?
3. **Data**: What data flows in/out? Storage needs?
4. **Security**: Any sensitive data or access control needs?

## Interview Phase 3: Validation
Ask the critical questions:
1. "What am I missing?"
2. "What could go wrong?"
3. "What would make this a failure?"
4. "Any assumptions I should challenge?"

## Output
After 2+ interview rounds, create the PRD and save to `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt`

Then offer to parse the PRD with Task Master to generate tasks.
